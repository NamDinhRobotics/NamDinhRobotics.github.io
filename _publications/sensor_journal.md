### Abstract
Calibration techniques for **multi-sensor data fusion** must ensure **high accuracy** in sensor positioning relative to the reference frame. However, the **point cloud data** generated by **low-cost LiDAR sensors** often possess **high uncertainty**, adversely affecting the calibration system. Additionally, **sensor displacements** may occur due to **undesirable conditions** during operation.

This paper proposes an **automatic self-calibration framework** for **multiple 2D LiDARs** on the **special Euclidean group SE(2)**. The key contributions of this work include:
- **Line Feature-Based Factor Graph Optimization:** Leveraging **line features** to enhance calibration accuracy.
- **Fuzzy Inference System for Adaptive Covariance:** Using **fuzzy logic rules** to adaptively modify the **covariance matrix** within the factor graph.
- **Real-Time Online Self-Calibration Algorithm:** Continuously corrects **sensor calibration variations** over time.

By mimicking **weight affection techniques** via **fuzzy logic rules**, the adapted covariance is incorporated into the factor graph for **enhanced calibration performance**. Our proposed method is implemented and evaluated on a **real-world dataset**, demonstrating **high accuracy and robustness** for industrial applications.

Experimental results confirm that our approach achieves **superior performance** in **self-calibrating multiple 2D LiDARs**, making it widely applicable for **autonomous systems and industrial robotics**.
