This paper presents an innovative approach utilizing **type-2 fuzzy logic** to enhance **factor graph-based pose estimation** with **multi-sensor fusion**. Traditional factor graph optimization techniques face challenges in handling **uncertainty** and **non-linearity**, especially in **dynamic and unstructured environments**.

The proposed **type-2 fuzzy logic framework** models **uncertainty** more effectively by adapting **fuzzy membership functions** within factor graph constraints, leading to **improved robustness** in pose estimation. Our approach leverages **multi-sensor fusion**, integrating data from **LiDAR, IMU, cameras, and GNSS**, ensuring accurate and resilient localization for **autonomous navigation**.

Key contributions:
- Development of a **type-2 fuzzy logic-based optimization strategy** for factor graph models.
- Improved robustness against **sensor noise and environmental uncertainty**.
- Comprehensive evaluation on **real-world datasets** and comparison with **state-of-the-art methods**.

The proposed system achieves **state-of-the-art performance**, outperforming existing techniques in **challenging scenarios**. Extensive **simulations and real-world experiments** validate the effectiveness of our approach.
