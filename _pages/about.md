This is the front page of my personal academic website. I am a researcher specializing in Robotics, SLAM, and Motion Planning, currently working as the **Lead of Motion Planning Control** at **VinAI**. You can visit my professional page [here](https://sites.google.com/view/dinhnam).

# About Me

I was a **Brain Korea postdoctoral researcher**, leading the **sensor fusion for agricultural robots**, in collaboration with **PINE S&S in South Korea in 2022**. Additionally, I was part of the **Clothoid team**, which ranked **fifth in the Hyundai self-driving competition in 2019** in South Korea. I have contributed to numerous projects in **robot navigation systems for industrial robots and autonomous vehicles**.

I obtained my **Ph.D. in Control and Robot Engineering** from **Chungbuk National University, South Korea, in 2022**. Since **2013**, I have been a **lecturer at Vinh University, Vietnam**. Before that, I earned my **B.E. degree in Control and Automation Engineering** from **Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST), Vietnam, in 2012**.
